 *
 * This enumeration holds the identifiers used throughout the application to
 * refer to sleep modes when locking and unlocking. Make sure the contents of
 * this enumeration always correspond to the contents of the SLEEPMGR_modes[]
 * table, which is defined below. Do not touch the last entry SLEEPMGR_NUM_MODES

/*============================ MACROS ========================================*/

/*! \brief  Sleep mode configuration values.
 *
 * This table is defined as a macro, which in turn is used in the sleepmgr.c
 * file. This way, the table will be local to the sleep manager module.
 * This table contais the sleep mode configuration values for all relevant
 * sleep modes. Only include the sleep modes you intend to use, and make sure
 * the shallowest (most "awake") sleep mode is the first one listed, and the
 * deepest mode the last one listed. Do not include active mode, as that is
 * not regarded as a sleep mode as such. Make sure that the SLEEPMGR_mode_enum
 * is updated accordingly.
