 * \brief  XMEGA power consumption validation main program file
 *
 *      This file contains a simple program for measuring the current
 *      consumption of XMEGA devices in different sleep modes.\n
 *      The device cycles through ACTIVE, IDLE, POWER-SAVE and POWER-DOWN
 *      modes, spending 8 seconds in each mode.\n
 *      Note that the device will stay in POWER-DOWN.
 *
 *      The interval timing is done with the RTC and ULP as default clock
 *      source, which should result in approximately 1 µA current consumption.
 *
 *      \note The device is initialized with the LOWPOWER_Init(), which enables
 *      pull-up on all I/O pins and disables the JTAG-interface (if configured
 *      in lowpower.h). This results in the lowest current consumption if
 *      nothing is connected to the I/O pins.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR1010: Minimizing the power consumption of XMEGA devices
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html
