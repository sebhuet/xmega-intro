 * \brief  XMEGA sleep manager example main program file
 *
 *      This file contains an example program which initializes the XMEGA
 *      to the least power consuming state, and puts the device to sleep.\n
 *      By default, the XMEGA is put in POWER-SAVE mode, and wakes up every
 *      five seconds. The device stays in ACTIVE mode for 0.5 sec before going
 *      back to sleep. This gives a duty cycle of 10%.
 *
 *      The interval timing is done with the RTC and ULP as default clock
 *      source, which should result in approximately 1 µA current consumption.
 *
 *      \note The device is initialized with the LOWPOWER_Init(), which enables
 *      pull-up on all I/O pins and disables the JTAG-interface (if configured
 *      in lowpower.h). This results in the lowest current consumption if
 *      nothing is connected to the I/O pins.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR1010: Minimizing the power consumption of XMEGA devices
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html
